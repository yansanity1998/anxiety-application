# Guidance System Setup Summary

## 🎯 What Has Been Created

I've successfully set up a complete guidance role system for your anxiety application. Here's what's now available:

### ✅ **Complete Guidance System**
- **Guidance Role**: Full admin privileges with guidance-specific branding
- **Guidance Account**: `guidance@gmail.com` / `guidance123` (created in auth.users)
- **Guidance Dashboard**: Accessible at `/guidance` route
- **Full Data Access**: Can view, edit, and manage all student data

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. **`sql/setup_guidance_complete.sql`** - Database setup script (policies and functions)
2. **`sql/create_guidance_auth_user.sql`** - Creates guidance user in auth.users
3. **`scripts/test_guidance_system.js`** - Automated test script
4. **`scripts/simple_guidance_test.js`** - Browser console test script
5. **`GUIDANCE_SETUP_README.md`** - Comprehensive setup guide

### Existing Files (Already Had Guidance Logic):
1. **`src/auth/Login.tsx`** - Handles guidance login and redirect
2. **`src/App.tsx`** - Has guidance routing and protection
3. **`src/admin/GuidanceDashboard.tsx`** - Full guidance dashboard

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Run Database Setup
1. Go to your Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `sql/setup_guidance_complete.sql`
3. Run the script

### Step 2: Create Guidance User in Authentication System
1. In the same SQL Editor, copy and paste `sql/create_guidance_auth_user.sql`
2. Run this script to create the guidance user in auth.users

### Step 3: Test the System
1. Go to your app's login page
2. Login with `guidance@gmail.com` and `guidance123`
3. You'll be automatically redirected to `/guidance`
4. The guidance dashboard will load with full access

## 🔧 How It Works

### User Creation in Authentication System

The guidance user is created in `auth.users` (the authentication system), just like the admin:

```sql
-- From create_guidance_auth_user.sql
INSERT INTO auth.users (
    instance_id,
    id,
    aud,
    role,
    email,
    encrypted_password,
    -- ... other fields
)
VALUES (
    instance_id,
    gen_random_uuid(),
    'authenticated',
    'authenticated',
    'guidance@gmail.com',
    crypt('guidance123', gen_salt('bf')),
    -- ... other values
);
```

### Automatic Profile Creation

When the guidance user is created in `auth.users`, the trigger automatically creates the profile:

```sql
-- From handle_new_user() function
CASE 
    WHEN NEW.email = 'admin@gmail.com' THEN 'admin'
    WHEN NEW.email = 'guidance@gmail.com' THEN 'guidance'
    ELSE 'user' 
END
```

### Automatic Role Assignment

The system automatically assigns the `guidance` role to any user with the email `guidance@gmail.com`:

```typescript
// From Login.tsx - already implemented
const isGuidanceAttempt = email.toLowerCase() === 'guidance@gmail.com';
if (isGuidanceAttempt || userProfile.role === 'guidance') {
  navigate('/guidance');
}
```

### RLS Policies

Guidance users have full access to:
- ✅ **profiles** table (view, insert, update, delete)
- ✅ **anxiety_assessments** table (view, insert, update, delete)

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Set your Supabase credentials
export SUPABASE_URL="your_supabase_url"
export SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your_supabase_anon_key"

# Run the test
node scripts/test_guidance_system.js
```

### Browser Testing
1. Open your app in the browser
2. Open browser console
3. Copy and paste the contents of `scripts/simple_guidance_test.js`
4. Run the test

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Role-based Access**: Only guidance users can access guidance dashboard
- **RLS Policies**: Database-level security for all data access
- **Automatic Role Assignment**: Based on email address
- **Protected Routes**: `/guidance` route is protected
- **Authentication System**: Users created in auth.users, not as profile entries

## 📊 Guidance Dashboard Features

The guidance dashboard provides:
- **Student Directory**: View all student profiles
- **Assessment Data**: Access to all anxiety assessments
- **Search & Filter**: Find students by name, email, school, course
- **Student Details**: View complete student information
- **Assessment History**: Track student progress over time
- **Contact Information**: Access to student and guardian details

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"Role column doesn't exist"** → Run the setup script again
2. **"Access denied"** → Check RLS policies in Supabase
3. **"User not found"** → Make sure you ran `create_guidance_auth_user.sql`
4. **Redirect not working** → Verify profile role is set to 'guidance'
5. **Dashboard not loading** → Check if `/guidance` route exists

### Debug Steps:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify user exists in `auth.users` table
3. Check if profile was created in `profiles` table
4. Check RLS policies in Supabase
5. Test login flow step by step

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Database setup script executed successfully
- [ ] Guidance user created in auth.users table
- [ ] Profile entry created automatically by trigger
- [ ] Login works with guidance@gmail.com / guidance123
- [ ] Login redirects to `/guidance` route
- [ ] Guidance dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] Can view all student profiles

## 🎉 What You Get

Once setup is complete, you'll have:

1. **A working guidance system** that creates users in the authentication system
2. **Full admin privileges** for guidance users
3. **Automatic redirects** to the guidance dashboard
4. **Complete access** to all student data and assessments
5. **Professional dashboard** for guidance counselors
6. **Secure access control** through RLS policies

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Run the database setup script** in Supabase
2. **Create the guidance user** in auth.users using the separate script
3. **Test the login and redirect** functionality
4. **Verify data access** in the guidance dashboard
5. **Customize the dashboard** if needed for your specific use case

## 🔑 Key Difference from Previous Approach

**Before**: Guidance user was created as a profile entry
**Now**: Guidance user is created in the authentication system (auth.users) just like the admin

This approach is more secure and follows the same pattern as your admin user creation.

The guidance system is now fully integrated and ready to use! 🎯
