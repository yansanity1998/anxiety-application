-- Simple Guidance User Fix
-- This script directly creates the guidance user in the simplest way possible
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- Step 1: Check current status
SELECT 'üîç Checking current guidance user status...' as status;

-- Check if guidance user exists in auth.users
SELECT

-- Check if guidance profile exists
SELECT 
    'Current guidance profile:' as check_type,
    id,
    user_id,
    email,
    role
FROM profiles 
WHERE email = 'guidance@gmail.com';

-- Step 2: Delete existing guidance user if it exists (to recreate cleanly)
DO $$
