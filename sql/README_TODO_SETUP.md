# Todo List Setup Instructions

## Database Schema Setup

To enable the todo list functionality, run the SQL script in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: sql/create_todo_list_table.sql
```

This will create:
- `todo_items` table with proper structure
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for users, admins, and guidance
- Indexes for optimal performance
- Automatic timestamp updates

## Update: Remove Pending Status

If you already have the todo table and want to remove the "pending" status:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: sql/update_todo_remove_pending.sql
```

This update will:
- Convert existing "pending" todos to "in_progress"
- Update the status constraint to only allow: in_progress, completed, canceled
- Set default status to "in_progress" for new todos

## Update: Add Guidance Permissions

To allow guidance counselors to manage todos (same as admins):

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: sql/update_todo_guidance_permissions.sql
```

This update will:
- Grant guidance users full access to view and manage all todos
- Update RLS policies to include both 'admin' and 'guidance' roles
- Maintain existing user policies (users can manage their own todos)
