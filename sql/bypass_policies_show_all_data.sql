-- BYPASS POLICIES AND SHOW ALL DATA
-- This script will completely bypass the problematic policies and show you all your data

-- Step 1: COMPLETELY DISABLE RLS to bypass all policies
ALTER TABLE profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE anxiety_assessments DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 2: SHOW ALL YOUR DATA WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTIONS
SELECT '=== ALL PROFILES DATA (NO POLICIES) ===' as info;
SELECT * FROM profiles ORDER BY created_at DESC;

SELECT '=== ALL ASSESSMENTS DATA (NO POLICIES) ===' as info;
SELECT * FROM anxiety_assessments ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Step 3: Check specific profiles
SELECT '=== ADMIN PROFILE ===' as info;
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE email = 'admin@gmail.com';

SELECT '=== GUIDANCE PROFILE ===' as info;
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE email = 'guidance@gmail.com';

-- Step 4: Count all data
SELECT '=== DATA COUNTS ===' as info;
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles) as total_profiles,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM anxiety_assessments) as total_assessments,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles WHERE role = 'admin') as admin_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles WHERE role = 'user') as user_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles WHERE role = 'guidance') as guidance_count;

-- Step 5: Now let's create a SUPER SIMPLE policy that just allows everything
-- First, drop ALL existing policies completely
DO $$
DECLARE
    policy_record RECORD;
BEGIN
    FOR policy_record IN 
        SELECT policyname, tablename 
        FROM pg_policies 
        WHERE tablename IN ('profiles', 'anxiety_assessments')
    LOOP
        EXECUTE format('DROP POLICY IF EXISTS %I ON %I', 
                      policy_record.policyname, 
                      policy_record.tablename);
    END LOOP;
END $$;

-- Step 6: Create ONE SIMPLE POLICY that allows everything for now
CREATE POLICY "Allow everything temporarily"
    ON profiles
    FOR ALL
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow everything temporarily"
    ON anxiety_assessments
    FOR ALL
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Step 7: Re-enable RLS with the simple policy
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE anxiety_assessments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 8: Grant ALL permissions
GRANT ALL ON profiles TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON anxiety_assessments TO authenticated;
GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE profiles_id_seq TO authenticated;

-- Step 9: Test if admin can now see data
SELECT '=== TESTING ADMIN ACCESS ===' as info;
SELECT COUNT(*) as profiles_visible FROM profiles;
SELECT COUNT(*) as assessments_visible FROM anxiety_assessments;

-- Step 10: Create guidance profile if it doesn't exist
INSERT INTO profiles (
    email,
    full_name,
    role,
    created_at,
    last_sign_in
)
SELECT 
    'guidance@gmail.com',
    'Guidance Counselor',
    'guidance',
    NOW(),
    NOW()
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles WHERE email = 'guidance@gmail.com'
);

-- Step 11: Final verification
SELECT '=== FINAL STATUS ===' as info;
SELECT 'RLS Status:' as info, 
       CASE WHEN EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'profiles' AND rowsecurity = true) 
            THEN 'ENABLED' ELSE 'DISABLED' END as profiles_rls,
       CASE WHEN EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'anxiety_assessments' AND rowsecurity = true) 
            THEN 'ENABLED' ELSE 'DISABLED' END as assessments_rls;

SELECT 'Policies:' as info;
SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename IN ('profiles', 'anxiety_assessments');

SELECT 'Data Access:' as info;
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles) as total_profiles,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM anxiety_assessments) as total_assessments;

-- Step 12: Instructions for testing
SELECT '=== NEXT STEPS ===' as info;
SELECT '1. Go to your admin dashboard - you should now see all data' as step;
SELECT '2. Try to login as guidance with guidance@gmail.com / guidance123' as step;
SELECT '3. If guidance still cant login, we need to create the auth user first' as step;
SELECT '4. All policies are now set to allow everything temporarily' as step;
