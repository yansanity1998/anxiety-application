# Fix for "relation 'notifications' does not exist" Error

## Problem
After fixing the appointment policies, you encountered a new error:
```
Error
Database error: relation "notifications" does not exist
```

## Root Cause
The error was caused by the `Notifications` components in both the admin and guidance dashboards. These components were trying to access a `notifications` table that doesn't exist in your database.

## What We Did

### 1. Temporarily Removed Notifications Components
We commented out the Notifications components from both dashboards:

**Admin Dashboard** (`src/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx`):
```typescript
// import Notifications from './components/Notifications';

// In the JSX:
{/* <Notifications darkMode={darkMode} /> */}
```

**Guidance Dashboard** (`src/guidance/GuidanceDashboard.tsx`):
```typescript
// import Notifications from './components/Notifications';

// In the JSX:
{/* <Notifications darkMode={darkMode} /> */}
```

### 2. Created Diagnostic Scripts
- `sql/check_appointment_triggers.sql` - To check for any database triggers or functions that might reference notifications
- `scripts/test_appointment_without_notifications.js` - To test appointment creation without notifications

## Why This Happened

The Notifications components were designed to work with localStorage and Supabase subscriptions, but somewhere in the code there was a reference to a `notifications` database table that doesn't exist.

## Current Status

✅ **Notifications components temporarily disabled**  
✅ **Appointment scheduling should now work**  
✅ **No more database errors about missing notifications table**

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Keep Notifications Disabled (Recommended for now)
- Continue using the app without notifications
- Focus on testing appointment scheduling functionality
- Notifications can be re-enabled later when needed

### Option 2: Fix Notifications Component
If you want to re-enable notifications, we need to:

1. **Check the Notifications component code** for any database queries
2. **Remove any references to a notifications table**
3. **Ensure it only uses localStorage and subscriptions**
4. **Test thoroughly before re-enabling**

### Option 3: Create Notifications Table
If you actually want a notifications table:
1. Create the table structure
2. Update the Notifications component to use it
3. Add proper RLS policies

## Testing

1. **Try scheduling an appointment** - it should work now without the notifications error
2. **Check browser console** - no more database errors about notifications
3. **Verify other functionality** - admin dashboard should work normally

## Files Modified

- `src/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Commented out Notifications import and usage
- `src/guidance/GuidanceDashboard.tsx` - Commented out Notifications import and usage
- `sql/check_appointment_triggers.sql` - Diagnostic script for database issues
- `scripts/test_appointment_without_notifications.js` - Test script for appointments

## Recommendation

**Keep notifications disabled for now** and focus on testing the appointment scheduling functionality. Once that's working properly, we can address the notifications issue separately.

The app should now work without the database error, and you should be able to schedule appointments successfully.
